# LeNet-and-VGG16-on-Mnist
This report presents an in-depth analysis and comparison of three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models — LeNet-5, VGG16, and a Custom Previous Architecture — evaluated on an image classification task. The goal is to assess each model’s accuracy, efficiency, complexity, and suitability for different environments.
